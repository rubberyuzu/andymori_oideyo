Using Polymorphism (vote, voteable etc..) for implementing a voting system.


Using Rails 3.1.18. 
(At first used 4.1.4 and used a rubygem called ProtectedAttribute (https://github.com/rails/protected_attributes ) for using "attr_accessible" in model files, which operation is not supported in Rails 4.1. )
